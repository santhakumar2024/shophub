# ‚ö†Ô∏è BLANK SCREEN FIX - FOLLOW THESE STEPS

## üî¥ Problem: Blank Screen / Nothing Shows

### ‚úÖ Solution - Follow These Steps IN ORDER:

## Step 1: Stop Everything
1. Close ALL browser tabs with localhost
2. Press `Ctrl+C` in any terminal running npm
3. Close all terminals

## Step 2: Use the Startup Script (EASIEST METHOD)
```bash
# Just double-click this file:
start.bat
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Check Node.js installation
- ‚úÖ Install dependencies if needed
- ‚úÖ Start backend server
- ‚úÖ Start frontend server
- ‚úÖ Open two terminal windows automatically

**Wait 10 seconds**, then open: http://localhost:5173

---

## Step 3: Manual Method (If start.bat doesn't work)

### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```bash
cd C:\Users\santhakumar.J.S\Desktop\shophub-ecommerce
npm run server
```

**‚úÖ SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:**
```
JSON Server is running
http://localhost:5000
```

**‚ùå ERROR LOOKS LIKE:**
```
Port 5000 is already in use
```
**FIX:** `npx kill-port 5000` then try again

---

### Terminal 2 - Frontend:
```bash
cd C:\Users\santhakumar.J.S\Desktop\shophub-ecommerce
npm run dev
```

**‚úÖ SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE:**
```
VITE v5.x.x ready in xxx ms
‚ûú Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

**‚ùå ERROR LOOKS LIKE:**
```
Port 5173 is already in use
```
**FIX:** `npx kill-port 5173` then try again

---

## Step 4: Test Backend Manually
Open browser and go to: http://localhost:5000/products

**‚úÖ YOU SHOULD SEE:**
JSON data with 12 products starting with:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Premium Wireless Headphones",
    ...
  }
]
```

**‚ùå IF YOU SEE:** "Cannot GET" or nothing
- Backend is NOT running
- Go back to Step 3, Terminal 1

---

## Step 5: Open Frontend
Go to: http://localhost:5173

**‚úÖ YOU SHOULD SEE:**
- Big blue header "Welcome to ShopHub"
- Product cards with images
- Navigation bar at top

**‚ùå IF YOU SEE:** Blank white screen
1. Press F12 (open browser console)
2. Look for red error messages
3. Common errors below üëá
